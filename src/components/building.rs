/// The locations of building models for each state are defined in
/// `/Hearts of Iron IV/map/buildings.txt`. An entry in that file is defined as such (If
/// unspecified, assume a number with up to 2 decimal digits):  
/// ```csv
/// State ID (integer); building ID (string); X position; Y position; Z position; Rotation; Adjacent sea province (integer)
/// ```
/// * State ID defines which state the building is located in. Even for provincial buildings, this
/// is the ID of the state, not the province.
/// * Building ID is defines which model is being located. While this includes each building, this
/// also includes floating harbours as `floating_harbor`.
/// * X, Y, and Z position represent the position on the map of the building model. The X and Z
/// positions are equal to the X and Y axes on the province bitmap with 1 pixel equalling 1 unit,
/// left-to-right and down-to-up respectively. This is also what the game uses to know which province
/// it's for for provincial buildings. The Y position, on the scale of 0 to 25.5, can be calculated
/// with the heightmap by taking the value of the pixel at that position and making it fit on the
/// scale of 0 to 25.5 (Such as by dividing it by 10 if it's on the scale of 0 to 255).
/// * Rotation is measured in radians. A rotation of 0 will result in the building model pointing in
/// the same direction as the model is set, while positives will rotate it counter-clockwise and
/// negatives will rotate it clockwise. A full rotation resulting in the same position as 0 is equal
/// to the number Ï€ multiplied by 2, roughly 6.28.
/// * Adjacent sea province is only necessary to define for naval bases and floating harbours, in
/// order to let the game know from which sea province ships or convoys can access the land province
/// where it is located. If the building type is not a naval base, it should be left at 0.  
/// It is preferable to generate the building models in the building section in the nudger, rather
/// than filling it out manually. However, note that the game will crash if the currently-existing
/// `/Hearts of Iron IV/map/buildings.txt` file is entirely empty, so there should be at least one
/// definition, even if incorrect.
